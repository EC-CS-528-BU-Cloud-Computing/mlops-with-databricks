OUTLINE:
* Highlight that the core of our project is "ops" not ML
* Discuss the services that we need to use/learn
* Discuss what kind of work goes into "ops"
* Discuss evaluation as a goal and what that looks like

FOLLOW UP:
* I didn't have any epics/stories/examples to give an example of what is *_in_* the scope of the project
* Are there any kind of metrics or specifics that we can use to evaluate the Databricks platform? I just wrote about how it is within the scope of our project to determine how we can integrate Databricks with current work.
