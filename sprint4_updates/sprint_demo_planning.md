# A File Where We Can Outline our Video Plans

* Here is a Google Slides presentation (in the same folder as normal) where you can add slides too: [Sprint 4 Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_lvefzfghFSCgiYigeKQvTwOpGC5BtrGD4rPbRkn2-g/edit?usp=sharing)

### Parker - Demonstrating Databricks API for Operations

* I contextualize my video as demonstrating how we can perform operations from outside of Databricks.
* Introduction (for my video specifically)
  - I dicuss how Databricks is good for data and models, but most operations that support the ML service are triggered and managed outside of Databricks
  - Then, I highlight out we can use Databricks' API to actions in databricks
* Core Content:
  - I emphasize that I am going to give an example of a simple API interaction between GitHub and Databricks
  - The demo I show in the video is not really very important in the grand scheme of our project but it is simple and easy to show/explain
  - In the demo,
    1. I update a file on my local computer.
    2. I push the update to GitHub
    3. I show how the update shows up in Databricks by using the Repos API even though I did not manual perform any git actions that would update the repos in Databricks.

*I'll provide more content shortly too ... gotta go back to my other assignment*
