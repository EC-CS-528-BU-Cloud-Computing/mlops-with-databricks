# Epic - First Task in Databricks

This folder is setup to keep records of all of our work on our first major epic in Databricks.

**We will store all of our work on this project in this directory on GitHub by either uploading each file or directly cloning and modifying the repo.**

**For members of the BU team**, please do the following...
1. Date all of your updates (at the least put start and end dates in your file s or something)
2. Keep track of contributors at the top of each file
3. *TBD if we need more*

# Replicaing Financial Fraud Detection at Scale

For our first "assignment", we will be replicating a financial fraud detection task from "The Big Book of Machine Learning Use Cases" published by Databricks. The task we will be replicating is in Chapter 5.

Link to the book: ["The Big Book of Machine Learning Use Cases"](https://www.databricks.com/p/ebook/big-book-of-machine-learning-use-cases)

This is intended to be an introductory task for working in Databricks. The process for completing it is entirely outlined in the book, so we shouldn't have to worry about the "programming" aspect of the task, instead we can focus on learning the platform.
